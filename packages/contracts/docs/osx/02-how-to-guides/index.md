## Welcome to the Aragon OSx How To Guides!

The Aragon OSx Protocol is a DAO framework, enabling users to create, manage, and customize DAOs in a way that is lean, adaptable, and secure.

With a few lines of code, the Aragon OSx protocol allows developers to extend the functionality of DAOs through the installation and uninstallation of plugins. Plugins are smart contracts which perform actions on behalf of the DAO thanks to being granted permissions.

<!-- TODO: will add section here referring to plugins that have already been deployed for devs to get some inspo -->
